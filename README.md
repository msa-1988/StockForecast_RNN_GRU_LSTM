Introduction:
This GitHub repository presents a comprehensive project focused on stock price forecasting using various recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, including RNN, GRU, and LSTM models. The project utilizes historical Amazon stock data to train, evaluate, and compare the performance of these models in predicting future stock prices.

The main objective of this project is to explore the capabilities of different RNN architectures in capturing temporal patterns and making accurate predictions in the dynamic and volatile domain of stock market forecasting. By implementing and analyzing multiple models, we aim to gain insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for stock price prediction tasks.

Key Features:

Model Design: The repository provides detailed implementations of RNN, GRU, and LSTM models using popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch. These models are designed to effectively learn from sequential data and capture complex temporal dependencies in stock price movements.

Training and Evaluation: The project includes training procedures for each model using historical Amazon stock data. The trained models are then evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess their predictive performance and generalization capabilities.

Model Comparison: The repository offers a comparative analysis of the trained models, showcasing their forecasting accuracy and highlighting any distinct advantages or limitations of each architecture. This comparison helps in understanding the trade-offs between model complexity, training time, and prediction accuracy.

Dataset: The project employs historical Amazon stock data as the primary dataset. The dataset contains a rich collection of features and historical price information, enabling the models to learn from past trends and patterns to predict future stock prices.

We believe that this repository will serve as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts interested in stock price forecasting using RNN architectures. By exploring the implementations, training procedures, and comparative analysis provided, users can gain insights into the performance and applicability of RNN, GRU, and LSTM models for stock market prediction tasks.

Note: It is important to acknowledge that stock price forecasting is a complex and highly unpredictable task. The models presented in this repository should be used for educational and research purposes only and should not be considered as financial advice or recommendations for actual trading decisions.
